# ATC-Dashboard-Tut
ATC club tutorial on plotly dash. 

We start with a tutorial on how to create common graphs using plotly. This can be found in the ATC_original_charts script. 


The dataset used is publically available on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows 


Once we've mastered how to create these charts, we'll walk through how you can create an app with Dash and create a simple static dashboard using the charts we created in the ATC_dashboard.py script. Finally we'll learn how to make our dashboard more interactive by adding a dropdown menu for one of the figures in the ATC_dropdown.py script.
